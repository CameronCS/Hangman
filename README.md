# Hang Man !!
 This is my clone of famous game Hangman.
 The game where you have to guess the words!
 
 Unfortunatly my design skills are rubbish so it looks very bland I'm sorry.
 
 It is quite arguably a bad clone but honestly I had fun making it!
 
 I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it
 
 ## How to play
 When you create the application youself you need to move the "Assets"
 and the "Words" folders to the "bin"(binary) folder where your '.exe'
 will be made
 
 Then you press play and have fun
 
 ## To Easy?
 If the game is too easy you can always add additional words to the "Easy", "Medium" or "Hard" '.txt' files
 This game is made for you to enjoy and customise
 
 ## Wanna see the code?
 No Worries! All the code is documented using the C# <summary></summary> documentation method
 
 A lot of the lines are documented to avoid ambiguity.
 
 ## Next update?
 The next update will allow you to add and delete words from in the app
 There may even be a "Setup" method required
